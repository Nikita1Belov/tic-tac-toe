# Tic-tac-toe
This is a popular tic-tac-toe game that was created using the Pygame library. This game has an intuitive graphical interface. You can play in classic mode 3x3 with your friend or with AI. You can play on a big field (from 4x4 to 10x10) with your friend (the possibility of playing with AI on a big-sized field is planned in the future). You can write your name in the game and your friend's name in the special text field (to do it you need just type on your keyboard and push button, text save automatically). However, if you don't write anything the program'll write down a name automatically. During the game nice music is playing but if you want to turn off it you'll push the "sound off" button (the "sound on" button is next to it). Your progress, AI's progress, and your friend's progress are saved in a general CSV file for all sizes as in a "special size" file. If a CSV file doesn't exist the program creates it by itself. The Window.py is the main file. Pleaser gaming!
